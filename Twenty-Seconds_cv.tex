\section{experience}

\begin{twenty}
  \twentyitem
    {2017}
    {Google Summer of Code}
    {Remote}
    {
    \emph{Improving LLVM Backend for Chapel Compiler}
    
    -  Improved vectorization by fixing serious bug and adding extra metadata in resulted code which in some cases improved performance of executed code by 400\%. 
    
    }
  \twentyitem
    {2016-2017}
    {Nokia, C++ Software Engineer}
    {Wrocław}
    {
    \emph{TTCN-3 Compiler Project}
    
     - Greatly reduced number of memory allocations in compiled code using object pool-like design pattern inspired by slab allocator leading to 20\% performance gain on average.
     
     - Reduced number of copy operations by introducing move operation in runtime and adding it to compiler code generation that resulted in 10\% performance gain in some cases. }
     
\twentyitem
    {2015}
    {Nokia, C++ Summer Trainee}
    {Wrocław}
    {
    \emph{Parsing library project}
    
    - Participated in library design inspired by Parsec library from Haskell language that was used to implement partial parser for TTCN-3 language.
    
    - Designed and implemented algorithm (based on pushdown automata) to locate changes in code in real time that would need to be re-parsed.
    
    - Integrated the algorithm into QtCreator to provide IDE functionality like auto-completion and jumping to function definitions.
    
    }

\section{project highlights}
\begin{twenty}
	\twentyitem
	{mimiker}
	{University of Wrocław operating system}
	{C, MIPS assembly}
	{ Played a big role in virtual memory subsystem, mutex implementation, gdb scripting, ramdisk loading, basic filesystems. Helped other students get into the project. }
	\twentyitem
	{quant}
	{Lossy Image Compression}
	{C++14}
	{Reduces image size by 80\% while preserving good image quality.
	Optimized typically slow algorithm by using specially tuned data structures, parallelising parts of code and modifying compiler flags.
	}
	
	\twentyitem
	{hCompiler}
	{Compiler that compiles tiny subset of C}
	{Haskell}
	{Compiles directly to x86 assembly using syntax directed code generation. Has working recursion and basic language constructs. }
	
	\twentyitem
	{GraphDrawer\ \ \ }
	{Visual and real-time editing graph drawing program}
	{Java}
	{Rich in functionality: performs various algorithms on graph, saves graphs as images, drawes pretty graph images.}
	
	\twentyitem
	{CubeSolver}
	{Rubik's cube solving program}
	{Python}
	{Finds solution to physical rubik's cube and guides the user through it. }
